"Axi" our base bot template repo has been refactored and made public for everyone to contribute to or fork. We will continue to make improvements and advancements to the bot but will keep it as a "template" and less of a "functioning" bot.

This will allow everyone that has either wanted to build a bot or wants to learn how to build a bot to have a secure place to start.

W3U is not only a service provider but a place to come and learn.
